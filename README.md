MusicPlayer
===========


######Project Proposal
###Vision: 
The project is to build an easily used and user friendly Music Player in Linux environment. 
###Milestone:
1 Be familiar with how to build Pygame environment and install corresponding libraries in Ubuntu.
2 Figure out how to find file location and upload files.
3 Write or search for functions for buttons, say, ‘Play’, ‘Pause’, ‘Next’, ‘Former’.
4 Figure out how to call functions when clicking certain button.
5 Figure out how to show the total time and played time when playing a music.
6 Try to support different formats of music.
7 Design the style and layout of the music player’s User Interface.
###Technologies:
Language: python. Libraries: python-pygame, python-wxgtk2.8.
###Users:
This Music Player would be useful for Linux based system users, and could also be used for windows users as long as they have Python for windows. All users just need to download the whole .rar folder on Github and install recommended libraries to run this wonderful Music Player.
